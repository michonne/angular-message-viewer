Using AngularJS to display and update our view with unique messages from adaptive-test-api

##Why AngularJS?

This JavaScript framework makes updating the DOM dynamic and modularises our code for easy
reading and maintainability.

It comes with alot of built in functionality to help us filter and update our view accordingly.
